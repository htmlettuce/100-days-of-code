# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

<!--### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: July 7, 2022
- Figuring out which career path I want to complete. 

**Today's Progress**: Front End Developer Career Path. plan html + css review. 3D modeling?

**Thoughts:** I forgot css pretty much, its very annoying because I used to remember it, but i think I need to try and find a note guide so I can remember and start reviewing more so I can solidify the concetps. Tomorrow I am also going to learn basic syntax in in GitHub because im really new to everything and I dont truly know how to use it. This will give me a chance to improve my GitHub skills alongside my code journey.  Last but not least, I am going to try and find some motivational videos/tedtalks to help me get out of this slump. 

### Day 1: July 9, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: HTML refresh + GitHub basic syntax.

**Thoughts:** I am working on building a cat photo app on free code camp to refresh my memory of HTML. I am going to work a bit longer tomorrow, but I am tired today so I only worked for about 30ish minutes. I am also going to rview some more GitHub fortmatting and syntax tomorrow. Another goal that I set for myself is to work on my typing skills. I enjoy coding and learning how to use code in a beautiful way, and I am going to try and find courses to work on problem solving skills because I hate math, and I think it would be best if I could learn it on my own time.

I am also going to refer back to codecademy and see how the two sites differ when it comes to course delivery. I am definitely going to continue through codecademy and use freecodecamp as a study method alongside it.

### Day 2: July 10, 2022 Sunday

**Today's progress**: Finished HTML lesson on freeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts:** I finished building the adorable cat photo app for my html lesson review. Tomorrow I am going to try to dive into CSS by building a cafe menu. I start a new job tomorrow, so I will have to figure out how I can incorporate coding an hour into my regular work day plus other household responsibilities I have. I am extremely excited to get back into coding and hopefully this challenge will teach me diligence and persistance. I am also going to try to do a project of my own, and that is going to be a book log! Today was a great day and tomorrow is going to be even better.

### Day 3: July 13, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working through CSS lesson + project

**Thoughts:** I finished my HTML lesson and began working through CSS by building a cafe menu. I am getting used to coding and the instructions behind it, but my next big goal is to figure out how to code and fromat things without being told specifically what to do with step by step instructions. When I get home tonight I am going to have free time to play minecraft so I think my next project may be a minecraft website or something along those lines. I also think I want to create a cat cafe app or something since I love both cats and coffee lol. I am going to begin working soon so I still need to find a way to fit coding into my daily schedule. Another project I am going to work on is a book hub library. I am going to do it of all the books that I have on my bookshelf and then I am going to work on making a 3D model of my office space, bookshelf, and possibly my kitchen. I havent started taking any 3D modeling lessons yet but I am going to work on that as well. I am getting back into my groove of coding and I am very excited for that. Also with school starting back soon, I am going to get back into my UX/UI specialty. Hopefully I can find an internship this year that will help me expand my skillset. I am going to try and focus most of my time during the schoolyear on design and user interface so I can grasp those skills and use them when I am designing websites. 

For some reason GitHub is not registering my typing speed with real time and its getting annoying so I think I am done journaling for today lol...

### Day 4: July 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished building cafe menu, moving on to colored markers project

**Thoughts:** I finished building the cafe menu and I forked it onto codecademy so I can add some things just for fun. I am moving on to a new project which is coding colored markers. I am pretty tired this morning so I am going to give myself some time to gather myself and probably do some school work before I code again either today or tomorrow. I need more discipline in my life when it comes to completing tasks not at the last minute. I have also been trying my best to type better but all good things come with practice lol. 



### Day 5: July 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS lesson for basics!

**Thoughts:** After I finihsed the CSS module, I thought now owuld be a good time to start my own personal project, so I am building a customizer for iced coffee form. Iam basically copying the basic code that I already wrote onto the new file and then customizing it further. I am thinking about making it pretty simple with a minamalist type of look, but I dont have much CSS under my belt so I am just playing around with what I know. I am hanging out with a friend today and we are going to work on code. Him and I are from two different backgrounds, hes backend and I am more on the front end. He's studying for job interviews so hes doing mainly SQL stuff right now. I enjoy hangingout with other software developers and working on our own projects. If it werent for him, I wouldnt have gotten into code so soon, but I feel that eventually I would have found my way over to this side of the tech industry. 


### Day 6: July 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Quick catch up journal

**Thoughts:** I have been coding every day for the past 3 days, but I have been forgetting to journal it hehe. I am working on a project of my own, and it is an espresso builder. Basically, you get to customize your espresso, and I am revising the HTML code and tomorrow or so I am going to begin working in CSS. I am planning on completing the box model lesson in Codecademy tomorrow so that can help me understand padding beyond using stack overflow lol. I am really enjoying this journey, and after this challenge is complete, I am going to move up to the #365daysofcode challenge. I am excited to finish learning CSS, but I am scared to begin JavaScript. I have heard from many people that it is a very tricky language to learn, but practice makes perfect. Last but not least, I am going to begin content creating for code related content. I am nervous because I truly have no editing skills whatsoever, but I am going to watch some youtube videos to help me. My life feels like it is finally coming together and I am eager to see how everything turns out, but until then I am going towork as hard as I possibly can to get to the point that I want to be.


### Day : July 

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:**


### Day 6.5 : August 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Grounding 

**Thoughts:** I am getting ready to go back to school Monday. I am goingt o really buckel down and start looking at Java code lesosns, and look more into what exactly I asm going to be learning in this class. I am going to use this opportunity to commit to my coding challenge, and also possibliy begin code content creation. I am currently watching a youtuber explain java but I think I am also going to use codecademy more so that I can get some self paced practice as well. I am making a commitment for myself and I am going to stick with it, and I am going to become the best version of myself. 


### Day 7:  

**Today's Progress**: Gathering resources again, finding foundations

**Thoughts:** I took a huge break off of coding for a while to try and figure some stuff out. I am learning that I am fond of front end development rather than back end. I am also learning how to pace myself more so I do not burn out easily. I am going to refresh my memory on html and I am going to dive back into CSS so I can begin learning JavaScript. After I complete that, I am going to begin learning python, bc one of my major courses requires a programming class. I initially tried learning Java but that was proven rather difficult for me at the time. I will try to be consistant with coding by doing a minimum of 30 minutes every day. I realized that one of my main problems is that I get too stuck in the aesthetics of learning something rather than actually doing it. I constantly compare myself to friends that I have that are much better at coding than me forgetting to include the fact that they have been doing it longer than me. 
To be continued, I am watching a pretty interesting show right now....
