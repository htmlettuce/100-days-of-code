**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: July 7, 2022
- Figuring out which career path I want to complete. 

**Today's Progress**: Front End Developer Career Path. plan html + css review. 3D modeling?

**Thoughts:** I forgot css pretty much, its very annoying because I used to remember it, but i think I need to try and find a note guide so I can remember and start reviewing more so I can solidify the concetps. Tomorrow I am also going to learn basic syntax in in GitHub because im really new to everything and I dont truly know how to use it. This will give me a chance to improve my GitHub skills alongside my code journey.  Last but not least, I am going to try and find some motivational videos/tedtalks to help me get out of this slump.
