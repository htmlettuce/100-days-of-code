**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: July 7, 2022
- Figuring out which career path I want to complete. 

**Today's Progress**: Front End Developer Career Path. plan html + css review. 3D modeling?

**Thoughts:** I forgot css pretty much, its very annoying because I used to remember it, but i think I need to try and find a note guide so I can remember and start reviewing more so I can solidify the concetps. Tomorrow I am also going to learn basic syntax in in GitHub because im really new to everything and I dont truly know how to use it. This will give me a chance to improve my GitHub skills alongside my code journey.  Last but not least, I am going to try and find some motivational videos/tedtalks to help me get out of this slump. 

### Day 1: July 9, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: HTML refresh + GitHub basic syntax.

**Thoughts:** I am working on building a cat photo app on free code camp to refresh my memory of HTML. I am going to work a bit longer tomorrow, but I am tired today so I only worked for about 30ish minutes. I am also going to rview some more GitHub fortmatting and syntax tomorrow. Another goal that I set for myself is to work on my typing skills. I enjoy coding and learning how to use code in a beautiful way, and I am going to try and find courses to work on problem solving skills because I hate math, and I think it would be best if I could learn it on my own time.

I am also going to refer back to codecademy and see how the two sites differ when it comes to course delivery. I am definitely going to continue through codecademy and use freecodecamp as a study method alongside it.

### Day 2: July 10, 2022 Sunday

**Today's progress**: Finished HTML lesson on freeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts:** I finihsed building the adorable cat photo app for my html lesson review. Tomorrow I am going to try to dive into CSS by building a cafe menu. I start a new job tomorrow, so I will have to figure out how I can incorporate coding an hour into my regular work day plus other household responsibilities I have. I am extremely excited to get back into coding and hopefully this challenge will teach me diligence and persistance. I am also going to try to do a project of my own, and that is going to be a book log! Today was a great day and tomorrow is going to be even better.
